This repository contains files for my master's thesis at the UW SPACE Lab in Aeronautics and Astronautics. My research is about the impact of a finite neutral backfill on the testing and operation of inductive pulsed plasma thrusters (IPPTs). My advisor is Professor Justin Little, PhD.

See Mathematica 12.1,2 development code of both single-pulse and multi-pulse operation of an inductive pulsed plasma thruster (IPPT) for time-evolving mass entrainment.
